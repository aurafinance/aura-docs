# Vote Locking

### Locking AURA

Locked `AURA` will facilitate governance of the Aura protocol. Those who lock their `AURA` before the start of the following epoch will be able to participate in all decisions surrounding the molding of the protocol. Locks last for 16 weeks.

These include its development and the allocation of the protocol accrued `veBAL`. Therefore locking will be required for users to influence the direction in which rewards are allocated. Other protocols have demonstrated the economic power this carries...

Aura lockers will be rewarded directly with `auraBAL`

### Delegation

It is possible to delegate your voting power to a specific address. This might be useful if you are not an active governor or you wish to take advantage of third party protocols.

After locking Aura, and before the start of the next epoch, you must delegate your vlAURA to yourself, a third party, or to Aura.

To delegate to yourself, select "Self Delegate."  To delegate to third party, navigate to "Delegate to a specific address," enter the address, then select "Delegate."  To delegate to Aura, select "Delegate to Aura."

Once delegated, "Delegating" will show the total amount of vlAURA being delegated, and "Vote weight" will display your voting weight.

# Launch timeline

### Phase 1 - Allowlisting

Post proposal on [Balancer forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow) and get allowlisted

### Phase 2 - Liquidity bootstrapping

Create initial liquidity for the $AURA token through an LBP and subsequent 80/20 AURA/ETH Balancer pool creation/funding.

Also support $AURA locking.

### Phase 3 - System bootstrapping

The goals in this phase are:

* bootstrap system `veBAL` balance through large incentives for `auraBAL` staking
* bootstrap token holder base through merkle drop to relevant ecosystem participants
* bootstrap Aura governors through incentivised Aura Locking

Additionally:

* create and incentivise liquidity for `auraBAL`&#x20;

### Phase 4 - Pools

Now that the boost has been bootstrapped, allow BPT deposits and introduce the long term `auraBAL` staking contract as outlined in [$BAL stakers](what-is-aura/for-usdbal-stakers.md#aurabal-staking).

### Phase 5 - On chain governance

There are multiple things that will be moved on chain:

* Internal governance proposals through `GovernorBravo`
* Balancer Snapshot voting
* Balancer Gauge voting

# Multisig composition

Multisigs will be used for the initial bootstrapping of the project, before things are moved entirely on chain.

In order to bolster decentralisation Aura will utilise a number of multisig wallets (Gnosis safe) for specific entities. The structure will consist of the following multisigs:

### Protocol Multisig

Initially consisting of 7 signers (4/7 majority needed). The proposed delegation of the signature keys are as follows:

* 3 x Aura team
* 2 x Balancer Ballers
* 2 x Reputable/known DeFi community members

### Treasury Dao

Keeping with the intention of Aura being a community owned protocol, its funds will be no different. All treasury keys will be delegated to respected community members across the Defi space with no prior or current affiliation with Aura.

The treasury will initially consist of 7 signers with a 4 sig majority required:

* 2 x Aura affiliates
* 5 x Reputable/known DeFi community members

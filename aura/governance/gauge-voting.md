# Gauge Voting

Directing the flow of incentives on the Balancer protocol is possible by voting for specific gauges. Substantial secondary markets are developing, like [Redacted Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/). This allows Aura Lockers to earn additional substantial rewards.

## Gauge voting rules and information

* Voting will be done via [Snapshot](https://vote.aura.finance).
* Gauge weight votes will be **bi-weekly,** starting Thursdays at \~02:00 UTC and ending on Tuesdays 02:00 UTC.&#x20;
* Individual **vlAURA** holders may spread their votes among multiple pools in gauge weight votes.
* Each gauge will have a hard cap of **50%** of Aura's **veBAL** assigned to it. Overflow will be distributed to other pools in proportion to their vote weight.
* Each gauge must receive at least **0.1%** of the votes before weight is assigned.
* **Unevenly** weighted gauges (i.e. non 50/50) will have a hard cap of **20%**.

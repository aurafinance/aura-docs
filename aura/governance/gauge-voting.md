# Gauge voting

It is possible to direct the flow of incentives on the Balancer protocol by voting for specific gauges. There are substantial secondary markets developing, like [Redacted Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/). This allows Aura Lockers to earn additional substantial rewards.

## Gauge voting rules and information

* Voting will be done via [Snapshot](https://vote.aura.finance).
* Gauge weight votes will be **bi-weekly,** starting Thursdays at \~02:00 UTC and ending on Tuesdays 00:00 UTC.&#x20;
* Individual **vlAURA** holders may spread their votes among multiple pools in gauge weight votes.

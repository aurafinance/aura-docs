# Multisig Rights

{% hint style="info" %}
The system is non custodial. There should be no circumstances under which it is possible for admin functions to pause, syphon off or redirect user capital and thus time-lock delays are not required.
{% endhint %}

### Immutable Contracts

All Aura smart contracts are immutable therefore there are no admin rights to update smart contracts

### Pausable Contracts

Aura smart contracts are not pausable, users always have control of their funds.

### Admin Functions

Most of all Aura governance follows the process described [here](./),  once the governance process has taken place then the  [Protocol Multisig](multisig-composition.md#protocol-multisig) can perform admin actions.

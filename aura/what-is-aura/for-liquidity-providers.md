# For Liquidity providers

### What are BPTs

Balancer Pool Tokens (or BPTs) are received from [https://app.balancer.fi/#/](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) for depositing assets into a liquidity pool. Read more on [their docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools).



### Balancer Gauges

These BPTs can be staked in Balancer Gauges  to earn $BAL rewards. Depositors are given a "boost" up to 2.5x based on their `veBAL` balance ([https://app.balancer.fi/#/vebal](https://app.balancer.fi/#/vebal)). To get a `veBAL` balance, users usually need to lock up `$BAL` in the Balancer VotingEscrow. That's where Aura comes in...



### Aura for Balancer LPs

Aura gives users the ability to continue receiving their trading fees but at higher APY due to Aura's protocol owned **veBAL.** Simultaneously Aura LPs will benefit from protocol native **($AURA)** tokens in the form of rewards.

Aura provides users the ability to maximise yield on their **$BPT** whilst offering exposure to the governance token of a protocol with the economic weight of substantial veBAL.

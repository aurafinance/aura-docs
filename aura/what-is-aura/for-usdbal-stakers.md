# For `BAL` stakers

### veBAL

Read about veBAL on the [Balancer docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/vebal-and-gauges/vebal).



### auraBAL

**`auraBAL` is tokenised `veBAL`**

Aura allows users to deposit their [`80/20 BAL/WETH BPT`](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014) here and receive `auraBAL`, instead of the non-transferrable `veBAL`. Tokenised `auraBAL` is given to the user at a 1:1 rate for `veBAL,` and can be traded on Balancer finance.

This BPT is then locked up by the Aura protocol for the maximum time in Voting Escrow where it will allow the Aura system to benefit from its voting power for boosting rewards & voting for gauges.&#x20;

#### auraBAL Staking

* `auraBAL` can be staked into the platform to receive normal Balancer admin fees one would get for normally holding their `veBAL`, in both `BAL` and `bb-a-USD`;
* Additionally, users staking `auraBAL` will receive `BAL` from Aura's performance fee, as well as the  platform native token `AURA`.

#### auraBAL Liquidity Pools

* Rather than staking `auraBAL`, users can also choose to contribute to the Balancer pool `auraBAL`/\[`80/20 BAL/ETH BPT`].
* Users can then stake the `auraBAL` BPT token on Aura Finance to receive a separate pool of `AURA` rewards for providing liquidity to others to enter and exit the ecosystem via the `auraBAL` token.

#### Governance power

The governance power from the deposited `veBAL` is controlled by [Aura lockers](for-usdaura-lockers.md).

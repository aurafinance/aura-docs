# Risks

Aura Finance has been built with safety and security in mind. However, there are inherent risks when interacting with any DeFi smart contracts. Our team has vigorously reviewed it's smart contracts, and also pursued external auditors to identify potential vulnerabilities in the platform prior to launch.

Even so, the possibility of losing some or all of your funds is non-zero. Please exercise caution and work within your own risk framework when it comes to interacting with the platform.

As well as Aura Finance specific risks, users are also beholden to any risks that pertain to the Balancer.finance platform, as we integrate directly with them. Please also review their documentation and risk explanations before interfacing with either platform.

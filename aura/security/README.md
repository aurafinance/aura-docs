# Security

Smart contract security is a top priority for those working on Aura Finance. All reasonable precautions must be taken to ensure the protocol is safe to use. Below is a list of some of the things we believe make smart contract systems secure.

### Audits

#### Audit 1 - Peckshield (4-18th Apr 2022)

A $150k, 2 week long audit competition ran on [https://code4rena.com/](https://code4rena.com/) allowed anyone with knowledge of the system, or just general bug hunters, a chance to come and contribute to the security of the Aura system before launch.

### Bug bounties

External bug bounties are essential for projects. Aura has placed a $1m critical bug bounty payout on Immunefi.

### Internal processes

#### Codebase

Some practices employed on Aura Finance smart contract repositories:

* protected `master` branch with mandatory peer reviews and passing CI (including linting, compiling, and testing)
* \>98% code coverage (using coveralls) and comprehensive integration tests
* Strict linting rules
* Code commented using the Natspec standard

#### Fork testing

Fork testing is helps simulate contract deployments and functionality in a live environment, accounting for external dependencies. Aura comprehensively tests deployments using fork tests.

#### Internal auditing

Developers know their code best, and dedicated time has been taken to manually review all code in the system.
